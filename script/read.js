                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>It was the late 19th century, and the Philippines was under Spanish rule. A young Filipino intellectual, José Rizal, had seen the struggles of his people and sought to open their eyes to the realities of their past, present, and future. He wrote two powerful novels—Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo—which exposed the injustices of Spanish colonization. But Rizal wasn’t done yet.
In 1889, he began writing a series of essays, one of which was The Philippines a Century Hence, published in La Solidaridad, a Filipino newspaper in Madrid. This work was different—it was not just a retelling of history or a critique of the present; it was a vision of what the Philippines might become in the future.
Rizal’s ideas were shaped by many influences, one of them being a German traveler named Feodor Jagor. Jagor had visited the Philippines in the 1860s and predicted that the country would one day fall under American influence. As a young student, Rizal read Jagor’s work and saw the wisdom in his observations. Years later, when Rizal met Jagor in Berlin, the two became friends, discussing how history was unfolding exactly as Jagor had foreseen. This convinced Rizal even more that Filipinos needed to prepare themselves for the changes ahead.
Through his writings, Rizal tried to awaken his countrymen. He republished Morga’s History to remind them of their rich past. He wrote Noli Me Tangere to paint a picture of their painful present and El Filibusterismo to warn them about the consequences of inaction. Now, in The Philippines a Century Hence, he presented them with a choice: what kind of future did they want?
The introduction also draws an interesting parallel to international politics. The story of Samoa—a nation caught in a power struggle between Germany, England, and the United States—was a warning. Rizal feared that the same fate could await the Philippines if Filipinos did not take control of their destiny. He knew that some idealists believed in international agreements to protect small nations, but history had shown that these agreements often led to exploitation rather than protection.
Even after his death, Rizal’s words continued to inspire. His vision of unity among Filipinos became a reality, and even Americans came to see him as a hero. Perhaps, if people truly understood his writings, misunderstandings between nations could be resolved.
At the heart of it all was Rizal’s deep faith in the future. He knew that his words might not be fully appreciated in his time, but he wrote them anyway, hoping that a wiser generation would one day read them and understand. As The Philosopher Tasio in Noli Me Tangere once said:
“I do not write for this generation. I am writing for other ages. If this could read me, they would burn my books, the work of my whole life. On the other hand, the generation which interprets these writings will be an educated generation; they will understand me and say: ‘Not all were asleep in the night-time of our grandparents.’”
And so, Rizal’s words lived on, waiting for the right time, the right people, and the right moment to finally be understood.

                <h2>Jagor's Prophecy</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time, a German traveler named Feodor Jagor set foot in the Philippines. He observed the land, its people, and its rulers, and in 1873, he wrote down his thoughts in a book. His words carried a prophecy—a glimpse into the future of the islands that would later inspire a young José Rizal.
Jagor saw that the world was changing rapidly. The Philippines, once isolated under Spanish rule, could no longer remain hidden from global trade and influence. Every ship that docked, every foreign investment that entered, was a crack in the foundation of Spanish control. The more the Filipino people gained exposure to new ideas and wealth, the more they would question their suffering under the old system.
He compared Spain to England. England’s colonies thrived because they were connected to the motherland through mutual economic benefit—raw materials flowed to England, and in return, British industries flourished. But Spain treated the Philippines like an heirloom rather than a living, breathing land with potential. Corrupt officials arrived with each new government, ignoring the talents and ambitions of the native-born Filipinos and half-castes. It was the same mistake Spain had made in its American colonies before losing them. If Spain continued on this path, Jagor believed the Philippines, too, would slip away from its grasp.
But Spain was not the only power in the picture. Across the Pacific, America was growing stronger. The western coast of the United States, once an empty wilderness, had transformed into bustling cities. Trade was booming, and the Pacific Ocean—once a vast, silent expanse—was now a highway of commerce.
Jagor saw the United States as a rising force, one that would inevitably reach the Philippines. The American way—driven by ambition, industry, and expansion—was the opposite of Spain’s rigid, exploitative rule. He noted that much of Spanish America had already fallen into American hands and had flourished in ways never possible under Spain. If history followed its course, the Philippines would also come under the influence of this growing superpower.
But this, Jagor warned, would be a challenge for the Filipino people. Unlike the Americans, who were restless and energetic, Filipinos had been kept in a state of passive obedience for centuries. If change came too soon, they might not be ready to compete with these aggressive, pioneering nations. The Philippines, he feared, had been lulled into a long slumber, and the awakening could be harsh.
Years later, a young Rizal read these words and took them to heart. Jagor’s prophecy convinced him that Filipinos had to prepare themselves for the future. Instead of waiting for change to come, they had to educate themselves, build their industries, and strengthen their identity—so that when the world shifted, they would not be crushed under its weight.

                <h2>I</h2>
                <p>Once, in a time of great silence and oppression, a man dared to dream of the future. José Rizal, a man of vision and intellect, looked upon his beloved Philippines and asked: What will become of us?
To answer this question, he first looked back into the past.
Long ago, the Philippines became part of Spain’s vast empire. But unlike a child nurtured by a mother, the islands were used as a pawn in Spain’s conquests, its people forced to shed blood in wars they never chose. In this struggle, the country lost more than lives—it lost its spirit. It changed so rapidly, so violently, that the people found themselves in a state of confusion—torn from their past, uncertain of their present, and blind to their future.
The Spanish rulers, concerned only with submission, fell like autumn leaves when a stronger master arrived. The people, never knowing true freedom, accepted new rulers easily, perhaps hoping for something better. But what came next was not liberation—it was a slow and painful transformation.
The Filipinos, Rizal said, were made to forget their own traditions. Their songs, poetry, and laws faded into the shadows, replaced by foreign beliefs that did not fit their nature. They were taught to admire the foreign and reject their own. Shame took root in their hearts, and soon, they looked down upon their own identity, seeing themselves as lesser beings.
Time marched on, and the chains of colonialism tightened. Religion, with its dazzling processions, golden images, and sermons in an unfamiliar tongue, hypnotized the people into submission. It was a slow and deliberate process. The goal? To break their spirits completely, to turn them into mere beasts of burden—without minds, without hearts, without resistance.
But Spain made a mistake.
In its arrogance, it insulted the very people it sought to control. It mocked their intelligence, denied their virtues, and treated them as incapable of even vice—as if they were nothing. This, Rizal declared, was their fatal misstep. For there is a limit to how much a man, a people, can endure. And when that limit is reached, the sleeping spirit awakens.
The Filipino, once willing to serve, began to see the injustice. Once willing to suffer, he now questioned why. Spain, in its panic, responded with more cruelty, punishing every cry of protest with death. But like a fire fed by the wind, resistance spread.
Not all Spaniards were oppressors. Not all Filipinos were heroes. But history, Rizal noted, was shaped by the will of the many, not the exceptions.
And so he asked again: What will happen next?
Would Spain change its ways and grant the Philippines true autonomy? Would the islands become a province of Spain, equal in rights? Would independence be won, and if so, at what cost? Or would the country simply fall into the hands of another power, trading one master for another?
There was no simple answer. For Rizal knew that history is never fixed—it moves like the tide, shaped by the actions of those who dare to rise and those who choose to kneel.
With this, he left his people with a challenge, not just a prophecy.
The future, he implied, was theirs to shape.

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>II</h2>
                <p>What will the Philippines be like in a hundred years? Will it still remain under Spain?
If this question had been asked three centuries ago, the answer might have seemed clear. Back then, Filipinos still held onto their warrior spirit, and resistance against Spanish rule was strong. Independence was not just a dream but an achievable goal, if only they could unite. However, as time passed, the chains of colonization became heavier, and generations were born into submission. The yoke that once felt unbearable became an accepted burden.
So, is the Philippines still in the same condition as before? Some Spaniards argue that the Filipino people have remained unchanged—still unrefined and unprogressive. Others, especially the friars, insist that the natives have been "redeemed" from their former barbarism. Meanwhile, many Filipinos themselves believe that centuries of oppression have led to a decline in their spirit and culture.
To truly understand the future, one must compare the past with the present. Three hundred years ago, Spain ruled the islands with only a handful of soldiers, barely maintaining control amid constant wars with the British, Dutch, Chinese, and Muslim raiders. The Philippines was isolated, disconnected from Spain, and poorly governed. And yet, Spanish rule endured.
Now, the situation appears much different. Spain's forces are stronger, communication is faster, and there are no serious external threats. At first glance, one might assume that Spain’s rule will last another three centuries. But beneath the surface, a more profound transformation is occurring.
Filipinos are an emotional people, deeply affected by pride and dignity. For centuries, they endured Spanish rule because they still saw Spain as a protector, a source of prestige, and a land of noble leaders. But now, that illusion has shattered. Where once they were given respect, they are now mocked and insulted. Once, they were part of the military and administration; now, they are treated as inferiors. Their loyalty, once freely given, has been repaid with oppression.
The friars, who once acted as defenders of the people, have become their exploiters. Public officials, instead of protecting justice, have turned into instruments of terror. Those who once sought to uplift the natives now openly insult them. The people who built Spain’s wealth in the islands are treated as savages, incapable of progress. A once-loyal population is now bitter, humiliated, and awakening to its true condition.
If this system continues, what will become of the Philippines?
The tension is building. If reforms do not come, a spark will ignite a fire that Spain may not be able to control. A revolution might once have seemed impossible, but what happens when a people realize they have nothing to lose? If suffering continues, even a suicidal uprising will seem preferable to a life of degradation.
Previous rebellions in the Philippines were small, disorganized, and led by isolated groups. But what if the next one is different? What if it is led by the people themselves, not just a few desperate soldiers or fanatics?
Spain still has choices. If it implements real reforms—listens to the people's grievances, grants representation, and restores respect—its rule may endure. But if it continues to insult, oppress, and deny them their rights, then change will come, whether Spain is ready for it or not.
The Filipino people are no longer the same as they were centuries ago. The spirit of a nation is awakening. If Spain does not adapt, it will face the consequences of its own arrogance.

                <h2>III</h2>
                <p>If Spain wishes to retain control over the Philippines, it must enact meaningful political reforms. Superficial changes will only worsen unrest, while genuine improvements can ensure stability. Some Spanish governors have attempted reforms, but these efforts have failed because they were not properly implemented. True reform must be radical, not just temporary fixes.
A free press and Filipino representation in the Spanish Cortes are essential reforms. Without a free press, the government remains ignorant of the real conditions in the Philippines. Without representation, Filipinos lack a voice in governance. Suppressing press freedom and denying representation only fuels discontent, potentially leading to rebellion.
Concerns that Filipino representatives may be separatists or unqualified are unfounded. If they oppose Spanish rule, they can be countered through debate rather than war. If they are corrupt, the fault lies with their constituents. If they are competent, they will help improve governance. Spain’s refusal to grant representation is unjust, considering that Cuba and Puerto Rico already have it.
Further reforms are needed in education, commerce, and law, but press freedom and representation are the foundation for all other improvements. Without these, Spain risks losing the Philippines, as other oppressed colonies have fought for independence.

                <h2>Rizal's Farewell Address</h2>
                <p>Rizal argues that history shows no enduring domination of one people over another with differing customs and ideals. Either the conquerors are expelled, as in Spain’s case with the Moors, or the natives are eradicated, as seen in the Americas and Australia. He warns that if Spain does not integrate Filipinos as equals, independence is inevitable.
Spain cannot exterminate the Filipino population, nor would it benefit from doing so. If denied education and freedom, Filipinos will seek them elsewhere, leading to resentment, conflict, and eventually revolution. Oppressive colonial policies fuel rebellion, and when a foreign power rules over a native population, even just punishments are perceived as oppression, deepening hostility.
Rizal predicts that if the Philippines achieves independence, no major power—England, Germany, France, or the U.S.—will readily take control, as their interests lie elsewhere. A newly independent Philippines would likely become a federal republic, rebuilding its economy and culture after years of oppression.
He urges Spain to grant Filipinos their rights voluntarily to maintain loyalty and prevent a violent break. If Spain remains deaf to these pleas, the Filipinos, having sacrificed everything in the hope of reform, will have no choice but to seek their own path to freedom.

                <h2>Rizal’s Farewell Address
Address to Some Filipinos</h2>
                <p>This is José Rizal’s farewell address to his fellow Filipinos, written on December 15, 1896, while he was imprisoned in Fort Santiago. In this document, Rizal distances himself from the armed revolution, condemning it as ill-conceived and premature. He emphasizes his longstanding belief that true independence should come through education and peaceful reform rather than rebellion.
Rizal asserts that he had opposed the revolution from the start and even offered his life to prevent it. He warns that a violent uprising would only bring suffering and discredit the Filipino cause. Instead, he advocates for intellectual and moral development as the foundation for achieving lasting freedom.
However, Spanish authorities viewed his message as subtly encouraging future rebellion, as it implied that independence could still be achieved under different circumstances. As a result, they decided to suppress the address and use it as further evidence against him in his trial.

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Rizal's Defence</h2>
                <p>José Rizal sat in his prison cell in Fort Santiago, awaiting a trial whose outcome had already been decided. The Spanish authorities had accused him of being the mastermind behind the rebellion that had erupted across the Philippines. They claimed he had organized revolutionary societies and incited Filipinos to rise up against Spain. But Rizal knew the truth—and he was determined to defend himself, even if no one in that courtroom would truly listen.
When the court-martial convened, Rizal laid out his defense with precision and calm. He began by stating a simple fact: from the moment he was exiled to Dapitan in 1892, he had distanced himself from politics. For four years, he had lived peacefully, dedicating himself to medicine, education, and community work. He had no connection to the revolutionaries, and he had never encouraged an armed uprising.
Then, he addressed a key piece of evidence—the visit of Pio Valenzuela. In July 1896, Valenzuela had come to see him in Dapitan, warning him that a rebellion was being planned. Rizal did not support the idea. In fact, he strongly advised against it. He had argued that the country was not ready, that education and moral reform should come first. If Valenzuela left their meeting convinced to abandon the plan, how could Rizal now be accused of leading the rebellion?
He also pointed out something odd: if he had truly been in close contact with the revolutionaries, why did Valenzuela have to travel under a false name? Why not just send a letter? The answer was clear—because Rizal had no communication with them. He had no part in their movement.
Rizal then turned to another accusation—that he had founded a secret revolutionary society, the Liga Filipina. Yes, he admitted, he had created the Liga in 1892, but its purpose had been peaceful. It was meant to unite Filipinos in economic and social progress, not to wage war. But after only one meeting, the Spanish authorities arrested him and sent him into exile. The Liga died before it could even begin. If others had revived it later, if revolutionaries had gone on to create the Katipunan, that was their doing—not his.
He could see that the court was not interested in hearing his reasoning, but he continued. If he had truly been a revolutionary leader, why had no one come to rescue him from exile? He had boats, he had freedom to move along the coast—he could have easily escaped if he had wanted to. But he didn’t. Instead, he stayed in Dapitan, building a small hospital and inviting his family to live with him.
He even had another opportunity to flee when he left for Cuba. When the Spanish government granted his request to serve as a doctor there, he boarded a ship without hesitation. If he had been guilty, why would he voluntarily place himself in Spanish hands? He had even docked in Singapore, a place where he could have easily escaped. Yet he stayed on the ship, because he had nothing to hide.
Finally, Rizal addressed the heart of the matter. How could he be the leader of a rebellion when he had never been consulted, when his advice had been ignored, when he had actively tried to prevent bloodshed? He condemned the revolution not because he did not love his country, but because he believed it was not yet ready to stand on its own. He had always advocated for peaceful reforms, for education, for progress through knowledge—not through violence.
But none of it mattered. The court had already made its decision. His defense would be ignored, his arguments twisted, his fate sealed. The crowd outside was already shouting for his death.
On December 30, 1896, José Rizal was executed by a Spanish firing squad. Yet his words, his ideals, and his love for his country would live on far beyond that day.

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Rizal's Response to the Rebellion</h2>
                <p>By the time the revolution broke out in 1896, José Rizal was already a marked man...By the time the revolution broke out in 1896, José Rizal was already a marked man. His name had become a symbol of resistance, though not in the way he had intended. The Spanish authorities saw him as the instigator of the rebellion. The revolutionaries, desperate for a leader, invoked his name to rally support. But Rizal himself? He was far from the conspiracy, isolated in Dapitan, unaware of the plans unfolding in secret.
It was not until July of that year that he first heard of the brewing revolution. Pio Valenzuela, a member of the Katipunan, came to visit him, bringing urgent news—the revolutionaries were planning an armed uprising against Spain. Valenzuela was not there to ask for Rizal’s guidance; he was there to warn him. “They have compassion for your life,” he told Rizal, “and they fear you might be implicated.”
Rizal’s response was firm. He told Valenzuela that the rebellion was absurd, that it would bring nothing but suffering. The Philippines, he argued, was not ready for such a drastic move. He advised patience, caution, reform through education and civic action rather than violence. He was not afraid for himself. If something were to happen to him, he said, his innocence would speak for itself. "Don’t think of me," he told Valenzuela, "think of our country, for it is the one that will suffer."
Valenzuela left, seemingly convinced by Rizal’s words. But outside of their quiet conversation, events were already set in motion. The Katipunan had begun spreading Rizal’s name as their leader, using his influence to inspire the revolutionaries. Yet the truth was far from this claim—Rizal had never agreed to lead, never given his blessing, never been consulted on their plans.
He would later ask a simple but powerful question: How could I be the leader of a movement I was never involved in? He had given no orders, made no arrangements, sent no messages. Those who swore he was the Katipunan’s chief had no proof—only rumors and their own motivations for using his name. "Either they have used my name for their own purposes," Rizal said, "or they have been deceived by others who have."
Since his exile in 1892, Rizal had kept his distance from political activism, focusing on medicine, education, and uplifting his fellow Filipinos in Dapitan. Yet, even as he was forced to defend himself in court, he knew that the truth no longer mattered. The Spanish government needed a scapegoat, and Rizal, the most famous Filipino of his time, was the perfect target.
In the end, Rizal’s words fell on deaf ears. He was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. But as he stood before the firing squad on December 30, 1896, he had already come to terms with his fate. His enemies thought they were silencing him, but in reality, they had immortalized him.
Even in his final days, Rizal’s heart remained with the Philippines. He had once written of the fate of his beloved homeland in a poem titled A Mi Musa (To My Muse), lamenting how his country rewarded its artists and heroes not with honor, but with chains and imprisonment.
Yet, in his last breath, he proved his undying love for his people—not as a revolutionary who waged war, but as a thinker, a writer, a man who, despite everything, still believed in the hope of a better future.
