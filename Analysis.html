          colleges, and universities courses on the life, works, and writings
          of Jose Rizal, particularly his novels <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and

          Students and teachers in the past years have relied on books and
          periodicals from the library to do their studies on Rizal. The advent
          of Information Technology, however, has facilitated the acquisition
          and sharing of ideas among people of varied persuasions throughout
          the globe.

        <h3>Enduring Relevance</h3>

          of colonial rule. Its themes of social injustice, national identity,
          and the need for reform resonate today—prompting modern readers to
          reflect on how history shapes our present and future.
