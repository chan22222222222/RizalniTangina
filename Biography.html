        <div class="about-text">
        <p>José Rizal, the National Hero of the Philippines, was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna. He came from a well-respected family and was the seventh of eleven children of Francisco Mercado Rizal and Teodora Alonzo y Quintos. Baptized on June 22, 1861, at the Catholic Church of Calamba, he was destined for greatness from an early age.</p>

            <div class="text">Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda was a Filipino nationalist and revolutionary. He is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines. Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, he was a polymath who excelled in various fields, including medicine, literature, and the arts. Rizal’s most famous works, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, exposed the injustices and oppression under Spanish colonial rule, inspiring Filipinos to fight for their rights. His writings and activism played a crucial role in the Philippine Revolution. Despite his peaceful advocacy, he was executed on December 30, 1896, in Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park), cementing his legacy as a martyr for Philippine independence.</div>

            <div class="text">Jose Rizal valued education as a powerful tool for national progress and enlightenment. He believed that knowledge and critical thinking could empower Filipinos to break free from colonial oppression. Rizal himself was a dedicated scholar, studying in prestigious institutions such as Ateneo Municipal de Manila and the University of Santo Tomas before earning his medical degree in Madrid. His writings, including The Indolence of the Filipino and The Philippines A Century Hence, emphasized the need for accessible, quality education. He criticized the Spanish colonial education system for promoting blind obedience instead of intellectual growth, advocating for reforms that would nurture independent thought and scientific inquiry among Filipinos.</div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="text">Jose Rizal’s legacy continues to inspire generations of Filipinos in the pursuit of freedom, education, and national identity. His writings, particularly Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, exposed the injustices of Spanish rule and awakened Filipino nationalism. Beyond his literary works, Rizal’s advocacy for peaceful reform and intellectual empowerment laid the foundation for the Philippine revolution. His martyrdom on December 30, 1896, solidified his status as a national hero, symbolizing the courage to fight for justice and self-determination. Today, his ideals live on through the educational institutions, monuments, and laws dedicated to preserving his memory and teachings.</div>
